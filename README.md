# Skeleton-display
The original Skeleton css code but with a few added extras. 

Show or hide elements, expand or contract elements, all depending on view port size. The initial idea came from the use of Foundation over the years. I love the way you could show or hide an element just by adding a class.

So I added classes for show and hide, plus I added classes to allow elements to change size depending on the viewport.

example:

Using three inline blocks (div), each with a width setting of m4 (typical grid is 12), and the view port is medium size(550px - 1000px).

I could make one of the div elements disappear while simultaneously make the two remaining divs change their width to an m6 (50% of the width) Making the element disappear is performed using hide-m (hide for medium);

I can also make the missing div reapear later for larger viewport sizes using show-l (show for large).

It's just a starting point but I'm extremely pleased so far with the results.
